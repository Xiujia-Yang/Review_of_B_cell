## Introduction of the codes

We organize our codes (either R or Python script) according to their applications. Generally, they fall into the following six categories,

1. Data preprocessing and cell population identification
	- RScript: DoubletFinder
	- RScript: Primary clustering & B cell secondary clustering

2. Gene regulation dynamics
	- Python: scVelo analysis 

3. Trajectory inference
	- RScript: Monocle2 analysis

4. BCR repertoire analysis
	- Python: BCR repertoire analysis

5. Cell communication analysis
	- Python: CellPhoneDb analysis

6. External data investigation
	- Rscript: Import data and preprocessing
	- Python: Customized scripts
