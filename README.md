## Introduction of the codes

We organize our codes (either R or Python script) according to their applications. Generally, they fall into the following six categories,

1. [Data preprocessing and cell population identification](https://github.com/Xiujia-Yang/Review_of_B_cell/tree/main/1_Data_prep_and_cell_ident)
	- RScript: DoubletFinder
	- RScript: Primary clustering & B cell secondary clustering

2. [Gene regulation dynamics](https://github.com/Xiujia-Yang/Review_of_B_cell/tree/main/2_Gene_regulation_dynamics)
	- Python: scVelo analysis 

3. [Trajectory inference](https://github.com/Xiujia-Yang/Review_of_B_cell/tree/main/3_Trajectory_inference)
	- RScript: Monocle2 analysis

4. [BCR repertoire analysis](https://github.com/Xiujia-Yang/Review_of_B_cell/tree/main/4_BCR_repertoire_analysis)
	- Python: BCR repertoire analysis

5. [Cell communication analysis](https://github.com/Xiujia-Yang/Review_of_B_cell/tree/main/5_Cell_communication_analysis)
	- Python: CellPhoneDb analysis

6. [External data investigation](https://github.com/Xiujia-Yang/Review_of_B_cell/tree/main/6_External_data_investigation)
	- Rscript: Import data and preprocessing
	- Python: Customized scripts
