# Review_of_B_cell
> [!NOTE]
> This repository hosts the codes used to produce the key results in our research article, "Single-cell analysis reveals multi-faceted features of B cell development together with age-associated B cell subpopulations".


We organize our codes (either R or Python script) according to their applications. Generally, they fall into the following six categories,

Data preprocessing and cell population identification
-RScript: DoubletFinder
-RScript: Primary clustering & B cell secondary clustering

Gene regulation dynamics
-Python: scVelo analysis 

Trajectory inference
-RScript: Monocle2 analysis

BCR repertoire analysis
-Python: BCR repertoire analysis

Cell communication analysis
-Python: CellPhoneDb analysis

External data investigation
	-Rscript: Import data and preprocessing
	-Python: Customized scripts
